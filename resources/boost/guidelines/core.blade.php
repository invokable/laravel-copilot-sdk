## Laravel Copilot SDK

- This application uses the Laravel Copilot SDK (`revolution/laravel-copilot-sdk`) to interact with GitHub Copilot CLI programmatically via JSON-RPC.
- Use `Copilot::run()` for single prompts, `Copilot::start()` for multi-turn sessions, and `Copilot::fake()` for testing.
- Activate the `laravel-copilot-sdk-development` skill when building, editing, debugging, or testing any Copilot CLI integration — including prompts, sessions, custom tools, streaming, RPC methods, MCP servers, TCP mode, or testing with fakes.
